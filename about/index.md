# Our Ethos
We believe that we are what we think, do and eat. We strive to help our members and the community to understand the profound relationship between our mind body and nutrition.
We pay due care and attention to this relationship and recognize that there are specific sequential steps that must be followed in the right order to achieve the desired result.

# What we do
We are here to help our members to:

- Take control of their own health and happiness

Self-help and Preventative wellbeing are now well recognized and promoted by the media and there are more and more new articles concerning all kinds of conditions from
Diabetes to Depression and Heart to Digestive Disorders which are recognized as being influenced by stress caused by living in the 21st Century.
We must now begin to take responsibility for our own health and happiness by taking control of our lives through taking control of our habits.

With the NHS under increasing strain to deal with an ever growing population that it wasn't created to serve – one that is vaster, older,
more stressed and with more sedentary lifestyles, it is time for us as a society to act on the old adage 'prevention is better than cure' and turn it into a meaningful way of life. 

There is a lot we can do at the most basic level to help ourselves to be fitter, stronger and more resilient both mentally and physically.
But there is a lot we're still learning! The role of the mind, hormones, our gut and microbiology, cells and DNA as well as our diet and activity levels.

With our focus on all wellbeing matters we can help you learn how to become a healthier and happier you.

- Empower yourself to make informed choices and actions about your own health

Previous experience with our charity ‘Smile2Live’, working with homeless people to provide supported living within our safe environment
and helping them to get back on track, showed us that the mind, body, nutrition approach works.
Starting with the mind and helping people to step back and see the impact of the choices they make and the set behaviours they have can start a process of change.
When we understand that we can control our own environment through making the right choices we can start to see how empowering our thoughts can be in developing positive behaviours and habits.

We can help you make positive choices that will benefit your health and happiness.

- Be part of a like-minded community

We are always stronger together. When we can learn from each other, inspire each other we can grow.
The Circle is an inclusive and welcoming environment that can benefit everyone, no matter their situation, needs or goals.

By becoming a member of The Circle you can join other like-minded people who are focused on improving their health and happiness.
