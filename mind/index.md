We all have thoughts and beliefs, conscious and subconscious; – some are more deeply ingrained than others, however, they all produce the cocktail of hormones to which we are addicted.
The resulting hormones strongly influence how your body behaves; the trick to creating real change is to learn how to change your subconscious thoughts,
beliefs and the resultant habits. It is certainly not easy but it certainly is possible when you know how!

You may think that you have free will to do as you wish? Your “will”, however, is always subject to your subconscious thoughts and beliefs;
therefore, whilst you may feel that you are making conscious free choices,

We provide workshops and classes to help you change your mind.
